## Unit 16 - Leaflet


This analysis creates a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from The USGS 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days' JSON file based on their longitude and latitude.


* The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. 

* Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.

* Popups provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
